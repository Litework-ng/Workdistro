## Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/workdistro.git
cd workdistro
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. **Start the Development Server**

```bash
npx expo start
```

- Use the Expo Go app or an emulator to preview the app.

---

## Development Workflow

- **File-based Routing:**  
  Uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for navigation.  
  Screens and layouts are auto-registered based on the `app/` directory structure.

- **State Management:**  
  Uses [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) for global state (auth, role, services, etc.).

- **API Communication:**  
  Uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) with a custom instance in `lib/api.ts`.  
  Auth tokens are automatically attached except for login/register endpoints.

- **WebSocket Integration:**  
  Real-time features (job offers, notifications) are powered by a WebSocket store and custom hooks.

- **UI Components:**  
  All UI elements are modular and themed via `constants/theme`.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory for sensitive configs (API base URL, etc.):

```
API_BASE_URL=https://workdistro-backend-1.onrender.com/api/
```

> **Note:** The current API base URL is set in `lib/api.ts`.  
> For production, update this as needed.

---

## Routing & Navigation

- **Auth Flows:**  
  Located in `app/(auth)/` (e.g., `/login`, `/register`, `/verifyOtp`).

- **Main App:**  
  Tabbed navigation in `app/(tabs)/` (e.g., `/home`, `/wallet`, `/profile`).

- **Onboarding:**  
  Role selection and intro in `app/onboarding/`.

- **Dynamic Modals:**  
  Global modals (e.g., job offer sheet) are rendered in _layout.tsx and triggered via WebSocket events.

---

## State Management

- **Auth Store:**  
  `shared/stores/useAuthStore.ts`  
  Handles user authentication, tokens, and user info.

- **Role Store:**  
  `shared/stores/useRoleStore.ts`  
  Manages current user role (`client` or `worker`).

- **WebSocket Store:**  
  `shared/stores/useWebSocketStore.ts`  
  Manages socket connection and event listeners.

- **Service Store:**  
  `shared/stores/useServiceStore.ts`  
  Caches available services for workers.

---

## WebSocket Integration

- **Real-time Events:**  
  - Job offers (`job_offer`)
  - Notifications
  - Status updates

- **Usage:**  
  Use the `useWebSocketEvents` hook to listen for events and trigger UI updates (e.g., show `JobOfferSheet`).

---

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:**  
  Write tests in `__tests__/` or alongside components/services.
- **Run Tests:**
  ```bash
  npm test
  # or
  yarn test
  ```

---

## Code Quality

- **Linting:**  
  Uses ESLint with Expo config.
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- **Type Checking:**  
  Uses TypeScript strict mode for type safety.

- **Formatting:**  
  Follow the existing code style and use Prettier if configured.
